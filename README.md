# Ramanujan's Number
That's my frist essay about web coding.
Son thsis is the first version of my first web code. It's about Ramanujan's number; Ramanujan's number is a special math number who can be wrote as the sum of cubic of two other numbers like 1729.
1729 can be wrote as the sum of 1^3 and 12^3 or 9^3 and 10^3. So this code is the version about this topic; I'm gonna write another version of this code, enhance him and let him look more interactive and dynamic.
Thanks!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜º
